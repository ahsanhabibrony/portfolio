                                        Shared Affairs wants everyone to have a free and easy means to transfer their
                                        information to their loved ones or other trusted people. We provide every
                                        registered person with a free, secure space to lock away information relating to
                                        their funeral wishes, their will and any information to help their family
                                        through the probate process. You can invite as many people as you want to
                                        receive any of that information in the event that anything happens to you. The
                                        information will remain locked forever as long as you sign into your account at
                                        least once a year or until you delete the information. You can also delete your
                                        account anytime you want, all your information will be deleted along with
                                        it.<br><br>

                                        Once your trusted people have accessed your information, they have 3 months
                                        before it is automatically deleted if you don’t sign into your account. They
                                        will not be charged to access your information either.<br><br>

                                        Just in case you need it, the free service also gives you another 3 folders (1GB
                                        capacity each) to store digital content such as video messages, documents,
                                        certificates, photos or letters that you may want to share with other people
                                        should anything happen to you.<br><br>

                                        Shared Affairs has committed to provide a free standard service that allows
                                        anyone to safely share their critical information with their family. Most people
                                        will never need more than this. Our business runs with revenue generated through
                                        our partners advertising relevant services to users as they use SharedAffairs
                                        and through partnerships with organisations. In future, we will also make some
                                        additional services available that we know people will be happy to pay for.
